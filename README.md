# alphamath

dennis's experimental math engine (a big WIP)

built with [mantine](https://mantine.dev) and [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/)

[try it?](https://thealan404.github.io/alphamath)

its a single page web app (all clientside)

## explanation

ive seen a lot of math solvers that assume you want to get a neat number and that there's only one result. this project aims to make a math solver that you can toy around with instead of just existing to find solutions.

### planned features

- [ ] addition
- [ ] multiplication
- [ ] fractions (division)
- [ ] exponentiation and roots
- [ ] absolute
- [ ] statements, like equality or inequalities
- [ ] contexts  
- contexts basically allow you to do things like "assume x=1" wihout affecting the statements outside of it
- [ ] sets, set operations and functions
- [ ] workspaces (basically a root context)
- [ ] pan/zoom/pinch around the workspace
- [ ] saving, loading and sharing workspaces
- [ ] graphs
